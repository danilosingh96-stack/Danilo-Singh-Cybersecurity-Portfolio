👋 Hi, I'm Danilo | Cybersecurity Analyst & Automation Enthusiast
I am an aspiring Security Operations Center Analyst with a background in computer science and a focus on defensive automation. I specialize in developing Python-based scripts that streamline access control workflows and manage dynamic allow lists to reduce administrative overhead. By prioritizing secure coding principles, such as utilizing context managers, I ensure data integrity and system stability across all automated operations. My work is backed by structured technical documentation designed to make complex security procedures repeatable, auditable, and accessible to team members. I am committed to leveraging these analytical skills to protect organizational infrastructure while working toward a career in professional penetration testing.

🛠️ Core Competencies
Security Automation
I develop Python-based scripts to streamline access control workflows and manage dynamic allow lists.
My focus is on reducing administrative overhead while maintaining a consistent security posture.

Defensive Operations
I prioritize secure coding principles, such as utilizing context managers to manage system resources effectively.
This approach ensures data integrity and prevents memory leaks during automated file operations.

Technical Documentation
I produce structured technical write-ups that translate complex security logic into actionable documentation.
My goal is to ensure that security procedures are repeatable, auditable, and accessible to team members.

🚀 Featured Project: Python Algorithm for File Updates
Project Overview
This project involved the development of a Python algorithm designed to maintain the integrity of an authorized IP address database. The script automates the synchronization process by cross-referencing live access logs against a list of revoked identifiers.
Technical Achievements

Automated Revocation: Engineered a membership-check system to identify and remove unauthorized IP addresses from restricted files.

Resource Management: Implemented the with statement to handle file I/O operations, ensuring files are closed properly and system stability is maintained.

Data Transformation: Utilized string manipulation and list conversion methods to transform raw text files into searchable, manageable data structures.

🎯 Professional Objective
My journey in computer science has developed a deep-seated passion for analytical problem-solving. I am now eager to transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I view the digital landscape as a realm that requires constant protection, similar to the Knights of the Watch manning the wall. I am committed to the long watch of monitoring and triage, ensuring that no threat slips through the gates unnoticed. My goal is to serve as a vigilant first responder, utilizing a defensive mindset to identify and mitigate threats in real-time.

🛠️ Core Competencies: The Defensive Mindset
I approach cybersecurity through a blend of technical proficiency and strategic thinking, drawing inspiration from various analytical archetypes to solve complex security puzzles.

🔍 Analytical Triage and Investigation
The Sherlock Holmes Methodology: I treat every system log as a crime scene. In the SOC, I focus on analytical triage, which is the ability to look at a messy data set and isolate the one piece of evidence or anomaly that others might overlook.
Puzzle-Solving and Escape Rooms: My experience with physical escape rooms has honed my ability to maintain composure under pressure and find the hidden key within a complex environment, a skill directly transferable to incident response.

🛡️ Threat Modeling and Strategic Defense
The Doctor Strange Approach: Effective defense requires looking at 14 million possibilities to find the single path to success. I utilize this mindset for threat modeling, anticipating various attack vectors to build a preemptive defense.
The Strategic Depth of Chess: I view network security as a high-stakes chessboard. My objective is to anticipate an adversary's next three moves, ensuring the core data is always protected by a multi-layered defense.
The Responsibility of the Spider: I operate under the principle that with great power comes great responsibility. As an analyst with access to sensitive systems, I prioritize ethical integrity and the careful stewardship of the "superpowers" granted by administrative privileges.

⚙️ Automation and Infrastructure
The Ingenuity of Stark Tech: My work in Python mirrors the Tony Stark philosophy of using technology to augment human capability. I leverage the simplicity of Python to automate any repetitive manual task—from log parsing to report generation—building a suit of armor around the organization that allows human analysts to focus on high-level threat hunting.
The Cyborg Integration: I strive for a deep, innate understanding of network infrastructure, viewing the communication between hardware and software as a single, integrated organism. This allows for faster troubleshooting and more secure system configurations.

⚔️ Long-Term Goal: The Tactical Penetration Tester
My ultimate career roadmap leads toward professional penetration testing. To be a master defender, one must understand the art of the siege.
The World's Greatest Detective Strategy: Like Batman, I plan to spend my early career in the SOC mastering the blueprints of every fortification from the inside.
The Will of the King of the Pirates: Much like Luffy from One Piece, I am driven by a relentless persistence to navigate the Grand Line of cybersecurity certifications, building the technical grit required to eventually lead offensive red team operations.
